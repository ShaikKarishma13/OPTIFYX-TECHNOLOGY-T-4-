# OPTIFYX-TECHNOLOGY-T-4-

*COMPANY: OPTIFYX TECHNOLOGY  
*NAME: SHAIK KARISHMA  
*INTERN ID: OPT/CS/2858 
*DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING 
*DURATION: 4 WEEKS (15th May 2025 -15thJune 2025)
*TASK:TASK-2 (LEVEL-2)

## Project Overview

The *Online Examination System* is a console-based Java application designed to simulate an online test environment with essential features like secure login, profile management, password change functionality, and conducting a multiple-choice question (MCQ)-based timed examination. It replicates the core functionalities one would expect from a basic online examination portal and is ideal for learning and understanding object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

The system supports a dummy user login, post which a menu is presented to allow profile updates, password changes, taking the test, and logging out. The exam consists of three multiple-choice questions and is limited to a 30-second timer, after which the test is automatically submitted. The goal of the project is to give a real-time simulation experience to both developers and learners in the academic domain.

## Features

- *User Login*: Ensures secure login with email and password validation.
- *Update Profile*: Allows the user to update their name and email information.
- *Change Password*: Enables the user to modify their current password for security.
- *Timed Exam*: Presents three MCQs to the user with a countdown timer of 30 seconds using Java's Timer and TimerTask classes.
- *Auto-Submit*: Automatically submits the exam once the timer runs out.
- *Session Management*: Clean session handling with logout functionality and structured menus.

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

- *Java Programming Language*: Core programming language used for the entire application.
- *JDK (Java Development Kit)*: Used to compile and run the Java source code.
- *Scanner Class*: Utilized for taking user input from the console.
- *Timer and TimerTask*: Built-in Java classes used to implement the exam countdown and auto-submit functionality.
- *OOP Concepts*: Object-Oriented Programming principles like encapsulation and class-based structure are demonstrated using User and OnlineExamination classes.
- *Text Editor / IDE*: This application can be developed and executed using IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.
- *Git & GitHub*: Source control and repository management for showcasing this project online.

## Functional Flow

1. *Launch*: The program launches via the Main class, which calls the runExamSystem() method.
2. *Login*: The user is prompted to enter an email and password. If correct (dummy credentials are hardcoded), access is granted.
3. *Menu Options*:
   - *Update Profile*: The user can change their name and email.
   - *Change Password*: Allows the user to reset their password.
   - *Start Exam*: Begins the 3-question test with a 30-second timer.
   - *Logout*: Ends the session and returns to the console.
4. *Examination*: The test is presented with three MCQs, and user answers are taken as integer inputs. The timer ensures that if the time exceeds 30 seconds, the test is auto-submitted.
5. *Score Display*: At the end of the exam (manual or auto-submitted), the score is calculated and displayed.

## Applicability

This project has several practical applications:

- *Academic Learning*: Best suited for students learning Java who want to understand practical implementation of OOP principles.
- *Interview Preparation*: Helps in understanding how to build structured logic for real-world use cases like session handling, timer-based actions, and menu-driven programs.
- *Mini-Project or Internal Assessment*: Can be showcased as a complete functional Java mini-project for college academic submissions.
- *Prototype for E-Learning Portals*: A prototype for understanding how real online test engines function under time constraints and session-based interactions.
- *Personal Skill Development*: Enhances command over Java classes, exception handling (can be extended), input validation, and user interaction logic.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Deepened understanding of *object-oriented programming* with user-defined classes and methods.
- Applied the *Timer and TimerTask* classes to create real-time events.
- Learned how to *structure a console application* with intuitive menu navigation.
- Developed a grasp over *session control* through login, logout, and user profile handling.
- Reinforced best practices like separating concerns (user data vs. exam logic) and handling user input efficiently.

## Conclusion:
The Online Examination System provides a strong foundation for understanding the building blocks of Java-based applications. By integrating profile management, user login, and a time-based examination interface, it offers a practical perspective on developing a real-world console application. This project has helped in honing my problem-solving abilities, logical thinking, and structured Java programming.
